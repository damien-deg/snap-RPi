snap-RPi
========

## What is this

A set of blocks and code to use Snap to ba able to use the GPIOs on a Raspberry Pi.

## Bits

- The blocks (currently 'block') in  RPiGPIO.xml

- The server 

## How to install



## How to run

Run the python script from your Pi (with sudo!). Access Snap! form your browser. Import RPiGPIO.xml file. You may have to change the IP address in the blocks so it points to your Raspberry Pi on your network.

## Caveat

Snap runs like molasses on the RPi. Don't do that. Until the performance issues are solved, you can run Snap from a server on the Pi (I use lighttpd) and acces it from a more powrful computer on your network. 

## Why doe this exist?

Because Snap! is easier to extend than Scratch.
